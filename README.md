# Stylus ERC-20 example (upgradeable through a simple transparent Proxy)

Implementation example of an ERC-20 token contract written in Rust for Arbitrum Stylus. This project also includes a Solidity Proxy to deploy the ERC-20 contract behind it, so it can be upgraded in the future.

Please note that this Proxy is based on the TransparentUpgradeableProxy of Solidity, but the ERC-20 contract itself is not Initializable.

## Getting started

Follow the instructions in the [Stylus quickstart](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/stylus-quickstart) to configure your development environment.

## Deploying and testing the contract

The `scripts` folder contains two scripts to deploy and test the contract:

1. [./scripts/deploy.sh](./scripts/deploy.sh) deploys the contract to the chain specified in the .env file, using cargo-stylus
2. [./scripts/test.sh](./scripts/test.sh) performs a series of calls to verify that the contract behaves as expected 

Remember to set the environment variables in an `.env` file.

## How to run a local Stylus dev node

Instructions to setup a local Stylus dev node can be found [here](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/how-tos/local-stylus-dev-node).

## How to get ETH for the Stylus testnet

The Stylus testnet is an L3 chain that settles to Arbitrum Sepolia. The usual way of obtaining ETH is to bridge it from Arbitrum Sepolia through the [Arbitrum Bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?destinationChain=stylus-testnet&sourceChain=arbitrum-sepolia). You can find a list of Arbitrum Sepolia faucets [here](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/reference/testnet-information#faucets).
